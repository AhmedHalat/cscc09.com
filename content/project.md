To succeed in web development, you must be extremely hands on. 40% of your course grade will be determined through this
project that you will work on as a group of 2-3 people. Your application must be deployed on the cloud and available
for the public to view and use. Please note that if you get <50% in the project, you will get no more than a 47 in your
final grade.

# Required Elements

You must demonstrate knowledge obtained in this class. These are the core requirements.

1. Frontend: Use a reactive frontend framework such as [Angular](https://angular.io), [React](https://reactjs.org), or [Vue](https://vuejs.org).
2. Backend: Your API must be RESTful where appropriate.
3. Deployment: Be deployed on a Cloud VM such as a DigitalOcean droplet, AWS Lightsail VM, etc. Do not deploy on Kubernetes, or non VMs like Heroku.

Furthermore, the project must complete at least 3 complexity points per team member.
(i.e. 6 complexity points for 2 people, 9 complexity points for 3 people)

Note that this project is not a hackathon project, and you will be graded based on successful application of concepts
as learnt in this course.

# Challenge Factor

If your team completes less than required complexity points, then your challenge factor will be less than 1.

Your team may optionally decide to do more complexity points, in which case, a bonus may be given based on the depth
of integration with the technology, up to x1.2. Please state in the `README.md` which complexity points are attempted
as bonus as they will be evaluated separately.

For instance, a challenging project with a challenge factor of 1.2 and a score of 78/100 will receive a final mark of 93/100.

# Syllabus

The project comes in 6 parts. All team members must put their best effort to contribute to the project. **The instructor reserves the right to assign
different grades to each of the team members based on their individual contributions on Github**.

| Deliverable                | Weight         |
| -------------------------- | -------------- |
| Proposal                   | 5%             |
| Alpha Version              | 5%             |
| Beta Version               | 10%            |
| Final Version              | 75%            |
| Video Demo                 | 5%             |
| Final Lecture Presentation | up to 5% bonus |

# Proposal (5%) - Github and Gradescope

You must register your team on [Github](https://classroom.github.com/a/ya3RGBPr) by the deadline. After registration,
each team will be assigned a new private Github repository for the project. By the project proposal
deadline, the team should have pushed the proposal to their project repository and **submit the repository to Gradescope**.
The proposal will take the form of a `README.md` file at the root of your project repository on Github.
This file should be properly formatted in markdown.

The proposal should contain the following information:

- Project title and team name
- Your focus (frontend focused or backend focused)
- Team members with student numbers
- Description of the web application
- What complexity points will this project contain
- (optional) What complexity points will be attempted as bonus for the challenge factor
- What you aim to complete for the alpha version, beta version, and final version

# Alpha Version (5%) - Github

You must schedule a 15-minute meeting with a TA. To receive full credit, demonstrate to the TA you have sufficient
progress towards a final product. This meeting is also an opportunity to raise any concerns about the team.

At this point, all your code should be pushed to `main` branch on Github.

# Beta Version (10%) - Github

You must schedule a 15-minute meeting with an assigned industry expert. During the meeting, you will demonstrate
a majority of features completed. You will be graded from 1-10 on how good this project is if it was considered in
a hiring decision. (1 - will not hire, 10 - definitely hire)

At this point, all your code should be pushed to `main` branch on Github.

# Final Version (75%) - Github and Gradescope

You must push everything to `main` branch on Github, and also submit the code through Gradescope.

You must add the application's deployed URL to `README.md`.

Your application must remain available throughout the marking period, which is 2 weeks after the final version deadline.
If the application is not deployed, you will not receive credit for the final version.

# Video Demo (5%) - Github and Gradescope

Record a 3-minute-long video demonstrating the core features of your web application. You should record the video as if
it was part of a hiring process.

Do not show slides, do not show code. Do not spend too long on unimportant features such as login/signup.

Upload your video to Youtube and include it in `README.md`. The presentation is going to determine who gets to present
at the final lecture.

# Final Lecture Presentation

The top projects of this course will be selected to present in the final lecture to showcase to the entire class.
Industry experts will be invited as judges to select the top 3 projects, which will get a bonus attached to their project.

# Recommendations

Here are some key recommendations to consider:

- Work on the most challenging parts first. Have them ready by the beta version.
- Deploy early, deploy often. Deploying is harder than you think and it requires major changes in the code most likely.
- Be careful with third-party APIs. Be aware of their limitations and restrictions.

# Academic Integrity

The course policy on academic integrity applies to this project. This means that all code developed for this project
must be written **exclusively** by the members of the team. Any use of UI elements and snippets of code found on the web
must be **clearly cited** in the credit page of the application.

You have the freedom to build whatever they want as a project, **however the following restrictions strictly apply**:

- You must not use your code that was developed from outside this course.
- You must not use your code that was developed for a paid or unpaid job.
- You must not use your code that was developed for another course, such as CSCC01.

Each team member is responsible and will be held accountable for the work he or she submits to the Github repository.
