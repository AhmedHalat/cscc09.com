To succeed in web development, you must be extremely hands on. 40% of your course grade will be determined through this
project that you will work on as a group of 2-3 people. Your application must be deployed on the cloud and available
for the public to view and use. Please note that if you get <50% in the project, you will get no more than a 47 in your
final grade.

# Required Elements
You must demonstrate knowledge obtained in this class. To obtain a **passing grade** (>=50%), your project must:
1. Use a frontend framework, rather than vanilla Javascript ([React](https://reactjs.org), [Angular](https://angular.io), [Vue](https://vuejs.org) or any descendants)
    - Note: If you decide to make a game, it must be web based and coded from scratch (not with a template), such as with
      three.js. Embedding Unity/Unreal Engine games on the web does not count.
2. Have at least 1 feature in your backend that is not a REST CRUD operation
    - For example, you have a websocket endpoint that can listen to events and change your frontend accordingly, or, your API is powered by GraphQL.
3. Be deployed on at least one VM (yes, managed Kubernetes clusters count) and must be accessible by the **public**.

# Challenge Factor
The course staff acknowledges that some projects will take more time than others. We encourage you to use more
complex technologies and more complex workflows.

Therefore your project will receive an challenge factor that ranges between 0.5 and 1.5 that we will use to adjust
your project final mark. For instance, a challenging project with a challenge factor of 1.2 and a score of 78/100 will
receive a final mark of 93/100.

To obtain at least a 1.0 challenge factor, a project must at least cover and implement three of the following concepts:

- OAuth 2.0 Client (Lecture 5)
    - Can your application interact with other OAuth 2.0 providers?
    - Do you request and use more than just the trivial scopes (eg. name, date of birth, etc.) from the external OAuth 2.0 provider?
- Real-time interactions (Lecture 9)
    - Can your application support real time interactions, such as real time collaboration? (Excluding real time chat, that is boring)
- Non-trivial frontend (Lecture 2, 10)
    - Does your application utilize more than just HTML/CSS/JS, such as HTML web components, animations, 3D rendering? OR
    - Does your application live somewhere unconventional? (i.e. instead of being a website itself,  is it an embeddable that can live in any arbitrary website?
- Webhooks (Lecture 9)
    - You either broadcast your own webhooks to external services, or receive and process webhooks from external services.
- No-code/Low-code platforms
    - Nowadays, barriers of entry to create websites/apps are getting lower and lower. Can your app allow non-developers to create their own apps/websites?
- Workers (Lecture 9)
    - You use workers to do processing that is independent of an HTTP call, such as sending emails 1 hour after registration, or batch data processing jobs.
- In depth work with a specific web technology
    - For example, you want to use webpack to implement module federation. This is an acceptable advance usage of Webpack.
- Integration with cloud technologies (Lecture 8)
    - Use technologies that cloud providers offer, such as Amazon Simple Queue Service, Cloudflare Workers, Google BigQuery, etc.
- Interactions with other hardware with web technologies
- Your application is fully end to end tested with a testing framework (Lecture 11)
- Other topics you may propose that are not covered above. Please talk with your TA or the course instructor to get these approved.

To obtain more than a 1.0 challenge factor, your project must cover more of the above topics in depth. For example, instead of integrating with external OAuth providers, you become an OAuth provider yourself. Here are also a few non-exhaustive concepts you could apply to increase your challenge factor
- Secure interactions with the operating system (Lecture 6)
    - Can your application securely interact with the operating system, or manage, or provision docker containers?
- Scalability (Lecture 8)
    - Does your application explicitly take into account scalability in its design?

Please consult with the instructor if you are curious as to what could affect your challenge factor.

# Don't
- Implement web based chat
- Implement another web gallery (or PDF gallery, or video gallery...)

# Syllabus
The project comes in 4 deliverables:
- Proposal 10%
- Beta Version 10%
- Presentation: 10%
- Final Version: 70%

The final version will be graded according to the following components:
- Does it work well? 15%
- Does it follow the best practices and design principles? 15%
- Does it take into account security considerations? 15%
- Is it well implemented? 15%
- Quality of UX/UI 10%

> All team members must put their best effort to contribute to the project. **The instructor reserves the right to assign
different grades to each of the team members based on their individual contributions on Github**.

# Academic Integrity
The course policy on academic integrity applies to this project. This means that all code developed for this project
must be written **exclusively** by the members of the team. Any use of UI elements and snippets of code found on the web
must be **clearly cited** in the credit page of the application.

You have the freedom to build whatever they want as a project, **however the following restrictions strictly apply**:
- the deliverable cannot contain any piece of work that was developed outside of the scope of this course
- the deliverable cannot contain any piece of work that will also be used for another paid work
- the deliverable cannot contain any piece of work that will also be used for another course deliverable

Each team member is responsible and will be held accountable for the work he or she submits to the Github repository.

# Deliverables
## Proposal
You must register your team on [Github](https://classroom.github.com/a/ya3RGBPr) by the deadline. After registration,
each team will be assigned a new private Github repository for the project. By the project proposal
deadline, the team should have pushed the proposal to their project repository and **submit the repository to Gradescope**.
The proposal will take the form of a `README.md` file at the root of your project repository on Github.
This file should be properly formatted in markdown.

To receive full credits, the proposal should contain the following information:

- Project Title
- Team Members
- Description of the web application
- 3+ concepts used for the challenge factor, and how each concept will be applied
- List the key features that would be completed by the beta version
- List the additional features that would be completed by the final version
- Describe the tech stack that would be used to build the application
- Describe the method of deployment

The instructor will assign a preliminary challenge factor for reference.

## Beta Version
By the beta version deadline, your team should have:
- pushed the beta version to the project repository on Github
- scheduled a 20 minute meeting to demo and discuss the beta version.

The meeting with the TA must be scheduled before the deadline but it can take place after the deadline. To receive
full credits, your team should demonstrate that the key features of your application work during the TA meeting.

## Final Version
By the final version deadline, your team should have:
- pushed the final version to the project repository on Github
- Submit the repository on Gradescope
- deployed the application and provide its public URL in the `README.md` file

The web application must be available throughout the marking period, which is 2 weeks after the final version.
**If the application is not deployed, a failing grade will be awarded.**

## Presentation
You are going to take a video demoing your app. This video must 3 min long (+-20 seconds). It should show your web app
(no slides, no code) and the soundtrack should be you explaining what you are doing on screen.

Upload your video to Youtube and include it in `README.md`

## Recommendations
Here are some key recommendations to consider:
- Work on the most challenging parts first. Have them ready by the beta version.
- Deploy early, deploy often. Deploying is harder than you think and it requires major changes in the code most likely.
- Be careful with third-party API. Be aware of their limitations and restrictions.
