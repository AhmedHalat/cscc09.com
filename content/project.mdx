To succeed in web development, you must be extremely hands on. 45% of your course grade will be determined through this
project that you will work on as a group of 2-3 people. Your application must be deployed on the cloud and available
for the public to view and use.

# Required Elements
You must demonstrate knowledge obtained in this class. To obtain a passing grade (>=50%), your project must:
1. Use a frontend framework, rather than vanilla Javascript ([React](https://reactjs.org), [Angular](https://angular.io), [Vue](https://vuejs.org) or any descendants)
    - Note: If you decide to make a game, it must be web based and coded from scratch (not with a template), such as with
      three.js. Embedding Unity/Unreal Engine games on the web does not count.
2. Have at least two features in your backend that is not a REST CRUD operation
    - For example, you have a websocket endpoint that can listen to events and change your frontend accordingly, or, your API is powered by GraphQL.
3. Integrate with at least one external API
    - If you donâ€™t have ideas, Github Student Developer Pack has plenty of external APIs you can work with.
4. Be deployed on at least one VM (yes, managed Kubernetes clusters count)

# Syllabus
The project comes in 4 deliverables:
- Proposal 10%
- Beta Version 10%
- Presentation: 10%
- Final Version: 70%

The final version will be graded according to the following components:
- Does it work well? 15%
- Does it follow the best practices and design principles? 15%
- Does it take into account security considerations? 15%
- Is it well implemented? 15%
- Quality of UX/UI 10%

> All team members must ut their best effort to contribute to the project. **The instructor reserves the right to assign
different grades to each of the team members based on their individual contributions on Github**.

# Academic Integrity
The course policy on academic integrity applies to this project. This means that all code developed for this project
must be written **exclusively** by the members of the team. Any use of UI elements and snippets of code found on the web
must be **clearly cited** in the credit page of the application.

You have the freedom to build whatever they want as a project, **however the following restrictions strictly apply**:
- the deliverable cannot contain any piece of work that was developed outside of the scope of this course
- the deliverable cannot contain any piece of work that will also be used for another paid work
- the deliverable cannot contain any piece of work that will also be used for another course deliverable

Each team member is responsible and will be held accountable for the work he or she submits to the Github repository.

# Deliverables
## Proposal
After registration, each team will be assigned a new private Github repository for the project. By the project proposal
deadline, the team should have pushed the proposal to their project repository. The proposal will take the form of a
README.md file at the root of your project repository on Github. This file should be properly formatted in markdown.

To receive full credits, the proposal should contain the following information:

- Project Title
- Team Members
- a description of the web application
- a description of the key features that will be completed by the Beta version
- a description of the additional features that will be complete by the Final version
- a description of the technology stack that you will use to build and deploy it
- a description of the top 5 technical challenges

## Beta Version
By the beta version deadline, your team should have:
- pushed the beta version to the project repository on Github
- scheduled a 20 minute meeting to demo and discuss the beta version.

The meeting with the TA must be scheduled before the deadline but it can take place after the deadline. To receive
full credits, your team should demonstrate that the key features of your application work.

## Final Version
By the final version deadline, your team should have:
- pushed the final version to the project repository on Github
- deployed the application and provide its public URL in the `README.md` file

## Presentation
You are going to take a video demoing your app. This video must 3 min long (+-20 seconds). It should show your web app
(no slides, no code) and the soundtrack should be you explaining what you are doing on screen.

Upload your video to Youtube and include it in `README.md`

## Recommendations
Here are some key recommendations to consider:
- Work on the most challenging parts first. Have them ready by the beta version.
- Deploy early, deploy often. Deploying is harder than you think and it requires major changes in the code most likely.
- Be careful with third-party API. Be aware of their limitations and restrictions.
